        ABOUT THE BOOK
        A gripping novel of encounters set in Tokyo during the spooky hours between midnight and  dawn, by an internationally renowned literary phenomenon.
                    
        Murakamiâ€™s trademark humor, psychological insight, and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery. Combining the pyrotechnical genius that made Kafka on the Shore and The Wind-up Bird Chronicle international bestsellers, with a surprising infusion of heart, Murakami has produced one of his most enchanting fictions yet.
